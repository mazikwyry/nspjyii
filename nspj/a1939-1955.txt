<p align="justify">The II World War broke out on 1 September 1939. In the morning the inhabitants of Wyry were surprised with the sound of the cannons and the view of the German planes arriving from the west. The parishioners gathered at the church on the sound of the church bells tolling and, together with the rector, left the village. They took the most precious and useful belongings and rushed into the direction of Tychy, Katowice, Miko³ów and Wolbrom. The wandering lasted for over two weeks. At that time, Wyry was the place of bloody war fighting. At the beginning of September, ten parishioners, who helped the Polish soldiers or stayed at home were killed by the invaders. Wyry was greatly devastated in the result of the war fighting. The people coming back from the wandering found only the ashes of their homes and shambles with the soldiers killed. On 3 September 1939, the Germans burnt the presbytery together with the barn and the stable. The south part of the church roof was also destructed because a shell hit it.</p>
<p align="justify">On 23 December 1939, Wincenty Nagi, coming from Wyry, took the holy orders. He was also one of the participants of the September War Campaign, and fought under the ‘Drobina’ pseudonym. He fought in the west and after the war he stayed in Scotland.</p>

It was the first service after the liberation and it was to thank God for saving the village from further destructions. ‘Te Deum’ and ‘Bo¿e coœ Polskê’ were sang during the mass. The believers taking part in that service were singing all the religious songs and hymns in Polish overcame with emotions and having tears in their eyes.
