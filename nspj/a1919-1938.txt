<p align="center">1919</p>
<p align="justify">As the result of long lasting efforts of the citizens of Wyry and thanks to the support of the rector of Miko³ów, the archbishop of Wroc³aw, cardinal Bertram, agreed to the foundation of the so called ‘kuracja’ in Wyry.</p>
<p align="justify">Teofil Kocurek became the first priest, the so called ‘kuratus’, in Wyry on 19 May 1919. He was nominated to that work by the General Duke-Bishop Curately of Wroc³aw. The Bishop Curia of Wroc³aw gave the power of attorney to Pawe³ Dworski, the rector of Miko³ów to consecrate the restaurant hall of Mr Wilhelm Seeman adapted to saying the service.</p>

<p align="justify">There were six thresholds leading to the altar in the sanctuary that was situated in the church hall and there were also two confessional boxes. All that was made by the carpenters from Wyry. In the back part of the church room, a three-meter wide landing with a balustrade was made. It was a place for the choir, where initially a harmonium was situated and which, later on, was a place for the organs made by the Klimosch u Durschlag company from Rybnik.</p>

</em>
<p align="justify">There was also a temporary presbytery situated in the house on Mr Tadeusz ¯oga³a’s farm. </p>
<p align="justify">Teofil Kocurek, the priest, took great efforts to start the building of a separate parish church in Wyry together with the parishioners. Mr Wilhelm Seeman, the owner of the restaurant and Mr Józef Bartel, the farmer, gave the suitable land nearby the nowadays church.</p>

<p align="justify">The Mining Office did not agree to the building of the church in the chosen place because of the extractions taking place underground. This was the reason of choosing another place, in the center of Wyry, for the foundation of the new church. The newly chosen land belonged to Mr Jakub Cofa³a, the farmer. Instead of the 11 200m<sup>2 </sup>of the land in the centre of the village the Duke of Pszczyna gave him 16 800m<sup>2</sup> of the meadow in the area of the railway along the stream from the ‘Waleska’ mine to the Gostynka stream. After all those troubles and preparations the building of the church was started in the spring of 1922.</p>

</em>
<p align="justify">The four-meter high walls of the new church appeared in the autumn of 1922. In the meantime of the building diverse difficulties appeared and they were still intensified by the growing devaluation of money.</p>
<p align="justify">The problems discouraged Teofil Kocurek, the priest, from continuing the works in Wyry. He left the place on 1 December 1922 and moved to the Wielkie Dêbieñsko parish, and then to Jaœkowice, where he became the rector after the building of the parish church there.</p>
<p align="justify">In May 1912, the first missions in Wyry were carried out by the ‘Oblaci’ Fathers.</p>
<strong>
<p align="center"><a name="1923">1923</a></p>
</strong>
<p align="justify">Jan Janota, the priest who was born in Bieruñ Stary, came to Wyry in February 1923. After graduating the University of Wroc³aw, he was ordained by cardinal Kopp in Wroc³aw.</p>
<p align="justify">Before he came to Wyry, Jan Janota, the priest, worked as a curate in Zabrze at St Anna church and then in the town called Ujazd. Between 1914 and 1922 he was the so called ‘kuratus’ in Koningswusterhausen nearby Berlin from where he came to his motherland after joining the Silesia to the territory of Poland. After a short period of awaiting he was nominated to be a priest in Wyry.</p>
<p align="justify">With the coming of the new priest the church building was started again. The church was covered with a roof before the winter of 1923 and during the next years the interior was being decorated.</p>
<strong>
<p align="center"><a name="1924">1924</a></p>
</strong>
<p align="justify">The most important event of 1924 was the apostolic visit of August Hlond, the apostolic administrator of the newly founded Katowice diocese on 23 May. The young parishioners also took the confirmation sacrament. The event was of great importance to the parishioners, because it happened for the first time in Wyry, but also because of the fact that August Hlond became the bishop of Katowice on 3 January 1926, and later the primate of Poland on 20 June 1926, and a cardinal the next year.</p>
<strong>
<p align="center"><a name="1925">1925</a></p>
</strong>
<p align="justify">On 31 May 1925, one of the most outstanding inhabitants of Wyry, Maciej Rydzko, died. He was one of the first inhabitants of Wyry and he had undertaken the efforts to found the new parish in Wyry already in 1907. He co-operated with chaplain Czernik from Miko³ów.</p>
<p align="justify">He was also devoted to the building of the new church after the ‘kuracja’’ foundation in Wyry and he sponsored the inside decoration of the church and the monstrance, among others.</p>
<p align="justify">The roman-catholic parish in Wyry was set with the decree of 29 July 1925 by the apostolic administration of Katowice and a great ceremony took place on Sunday, 4 October 1925. Jan Janota was introduced as the rector of the parish of Wyry by Jan Kopica, the prelate of Tychy, and by some other priests taking part in the ceremony. </p>
<p align="justify">After finishing the ceremony, all its participants walked in a procession to the new church, where Jan Kapica, the prelate, consecrated the cornerstone. It was inbuilt in the back wall behind the altar together with the chronicle of The building procedure.</p>
<strong>
<p align="center"><a name="1926">1926</a></p>
</strong>
<p align="justify">Although the building of the church was still not finished entirely, the parishioners had already started the presbytery building. It lasted almost two years and was finished in December, the next year. A 60 000 zloty credit was taken from the Treasury of the Silesian Province. </p>
<strong>
<p align="center"><a name="1927">1927</a></p>
</strong>
<p align="justify">On 26 June 1927, the new church in Wyry was benedicted by Jan Kapica, the prelate of Tychy. On that day also the first indulgence took place in the church. A new altar, confessional boxes and pews, all made by the carpenters from Wyry, were situated in the church. </p>
<p align="justify">The organs, done in 1919, and other furnishing, so far used in Mr Seeman’s church hall, was moved into the new church.</p>
<p align="justify">Two bells weighting 70 kgs were placed in the church tower. One of them was made of bonze in 1885 and another of steel in 1918.</p>
<p align="justify">A new baptismal font, done by the stonemasons from Wyry, was also placed in the new church.</p>
<strong>

<p align="justify">Thanks to the generosity of the parishioners new massive paws, which could place 370 people, were bought. Also the old pictured way of the cross was replaced with a new sculpted one, which cost 4 500 zloty.</p>
<strong>
<p align="center"><a name="1929">1929</a></p>
</strong>
<p align="justify">The church was equipped with new fitting. The statue of Jesus in the Holy Grave was bought with 1 000 zloty. The lads bought a brass lantern and gave it as a gift to the church. With the parishioners’ donation the electric lightning was installed. It consisted of four hanging lamps with shades that were set on the four pillars in the sanctuary and on the two pillars at the choir.</p>
<p align="justify">The way of the cross sculptures were also lighted with candle shaped bulbs and 50 such bulbs were additionally placed in the frame of Jesus’ Sacred Heart picture in the main altar.</p>
<p align="justify">A wonderful bronze chandelier, of 1 200 zloty worth, was founded by Mr Leopold Mañka, the baker from Wyry and the church sacristian at the same time. It was hanged in the middle of the church. There were 50 electric candle shaped bulbs in the chandelier.</p>

<p align="justify">1931 was another year of the great crisis overruling the world for the period of several years. </p>
<p align="justify">The citizens of Wyry also severely experienced the unemployment resulting form the closing of the following mines. On 15 April 1931 ‘Szczêœcie Henryka’, the mine in Wyry was closed and half of the miners of the nearby mine called ‘Boles³aw Œmia³y’ were dismissed from work. The rest of the workers worked in the so called ‘periods’, which meant that they worked every three months. Additional free days called ‘holidays’ (‘œwiêtówki’), were also introduced.</p>
<p align="justify">A kitchen for the unemployed, which was initiated in Wyry, did not solve all the unemployment problems. The unemployed started building the so called ‘field shafts’ (‘biedaszyby’), on the wasteland nearby Miko³ów, from which they extracted the coal for their own needs and for sale. In 1932 there were more or less 30 such shafts from which around 200 tons of coal was extracted.</p>
<strong>
<p align="center"><a name="1933">1933</a></p>
</strong>
<p align="justify">1933 was a year of a great jubilee of the rector of our parish. Jan Janota celebrated two jubilee dates in that year: 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his priesthood,</p>
<p align="justify">and his 50<sup>th </sup>birthday. On that occasion, the girls of the Virgin Mary’s congregation founded a wonderfully embroidered, colourful and decorative altar and pulpit clothes.</p>

<p align="justify">A canonical visit of Ph.D. Teofil Bromboszcz, the first ’Sufragan’ bishop of the Katowice diocese, was a very important event in Wyry in 1934.</p>

</strong>
<p align="justify">Between 1924 and 1935 the activity of diverse sects rapidly increased in the nearby parishes but they did not find any followers in Wyry. To make the belief more profound another, the second in order, missions were carried out in Wyry in 1935. They lasted since 30 March to 8 April and they had a very solemn setting. The Franciscan fathers from Panewniki, who were to preach sermons, were wholeheartedly welcomed by the parishioners of Wyry. Out of the three missioners, father Pankracy was liked most. The number of 5 300 hosts served prove the great involvement of the parishioners into the missions.</p>

<p align="justify">The whole inside of the church was painted light beige in 1936. At the same time the sanctuary was decorated with beautiful pastel paintings. A painting portraying God with a long beard and stretched arms together with two angels appeared on the ceiling of the dome. A shining monstrance surrounded with the angels in clouds was painted over the main altar.</p>
<p align="justify">Jan Janota, the rector, was taking great care of the church and its decoration and furnishing.</p>

<p align="justify">After many years of the economic crisis, the time of significant improvement of living conditions came. </p>
<p align="justify">New investments were done in our church. A new altar was built in the sanctuary with the statue of Jesus in the middle of it, St Barbara on the left and St Joseph on the right. The pulpit was placed on the right side of the nave and the sanctuary was separated from the remaining part of the church with beautifully sculpted gallery. The confessional boxes, situated at the back side of the church, below the choir, were sculpted in the same style and all that was done by an artist sculptor, Mr Konarzewski form Istebna. The angels holding electrical candlesticks were placed on the side pillars of the sanctuary.</p>
